# Ice-Arrested-List
This is a MySQL and Power BI data cleaning and visualisation project created to understand whether the Trump administration has ramped up the arrests of people that are deemed to be criminals or have broken immigration law compared to the Biden administration, as well as to understand the relationship between the number of arrests and cities, nationality of individuals, gender, and method of arrest.

This repository consists of the cleaned dataset, the MySQL script of the data cleaning and the end result of the project with the dashboard within. Due to file size concerns, the original dataset is not uploaded here.

All documents within are free to be used as your own.
